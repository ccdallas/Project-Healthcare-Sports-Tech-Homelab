# 🔐 Healthcare + Sports Tech Cybersecurity Homelab

Welcome to my cybersecurity homelab — where emergency medicine meets ethical hacking!

As a former ER nurse turned cybersecurity analyst, I'm building out real-world use cases to simulate, secure, and respond to threats in healthcare and sports environments.

## 🩺 Lab Focus Areas
- Medical Device Security
- HIPAA/EHR Attack Simulation
- Wearable Tech Threat Emulation
- SOC Tools: SIEM, Sysmon, Sigma Rules
- Home-built Threat Intelligence Feed

## 🛠 Tools & Tech
- VirtualBox / Proxmox
- Kali Linux, Ubuntu Server, Security Onion
- Elastic Stack (ELK)
- Wireshark, Zeek, Suricata
- Splunk (free tier)
- Python / Bash automation

## 💡 Why This Lab?
Hands-on practice is key for transitioning from theory to real-world defense. I'm creating labs that reflect both the chaos of the ER and the emerging needs of digital health and sports tech.

## 🚧 Current Status
✅ External hard drive set up  
🔄 Installing core VMs  
📍 Next up: SOC simulation with live packet capture
